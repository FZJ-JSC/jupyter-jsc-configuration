            <p>
                The Jupyter-JSC Service uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in
                a computer system via a web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
                so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It
                consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers
                can be assigned to the specific web browser in which the cookie was
                stored. This allows visited websites and servers to differentiate
                the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers
                that contain other cookies. A specific web browser can be recognized
                and identified using the unique cookie ID.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Jupyter-JSC Service needs cookies for its functionality. It would not be
                possible to determine whether a user is logged in or not without the use
                of cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our service can be
                optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously
                mentioned, to recognize our service users. The purpose of this recognition
                is to make it easier for users to utilize our service. The service user
                that uses cookies e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the
                service is accessed, because this is taken over by the service, and the
                cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our service
                using a corresponding setting of the web browser used, and may
                thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set
                cookies may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other
                software programs. This is possible in all popular web browsers. If
                you deactivate the setting of cookies in the web browser used, not
                all functions of our service may be entirely usable.
