          <p>
            The Jupyter-JSC Service uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in
            a computer system via a web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
            so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It
            consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers
            can be assigned to the specific web browser in which the cookie was
            stored. This allows visited websites and servers to differentiate
            the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers
            that contain other cookies. A specific web browser can be recognized
            and identified using the unique cookie ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jupyter-JSC Service needs cookies for its functionality. It would not be
            possible to determine whether a user is logged in or not without the use
            of cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our service can be
            optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously
            mentioned, to recognize our service users. The purpose of this recognition
            is to make it easier for users to utilize our service. The service user
            that uses cookies e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the
            service is accessed, because this is taken over by the service, and the
            cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our service
            using a corresponding setting of the web browser used, and may
            thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set
            cookies may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other
            software programs. This is possible in all popular web browsers. If
            you deactivate the setting of cookies in the web browser used, not
            all functions of our service may be entirely usable.
